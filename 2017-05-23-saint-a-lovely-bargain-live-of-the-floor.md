#### Artist Bio

*Mohammed Sillah was born in Serekunda, Gambia on February 8, 1997. As a teenage refugee he fled to Sweden during 2012 with only a backpack and the clothes on his back. Upon his arrival he applied for asylum in Sweden.*

*Between 2012-2015, Saint was relocated to various refugee camps by the Swedish Migration Board. His application for asylum in Sweden was initially denied, as well as several appeals for over a year leaving his stay in Sweden uncertain.*

*In early 2014 he was introduced to Swedish recording artist Rebstar through a mutual friend who worked at the refugee camp. Saint went on to eventually sign with Swedish record label Today Is Vintage. In March 2015, they released Saint's debut single Chillin to major acclaim and quickly rose to prominence in Sweden. In 2015 Saint was granted permanent residency in Sweden.*
